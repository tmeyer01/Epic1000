            This is not an official race/ride/event in any capacity. It is an
            informal ride done along the same route made up of public trails and
            roads by a few of us every year that you are welcome to join
            entirely at your own risk as if you were riding it on your own.

            bikepacking group ride in the spirit the underground 'Tour divide'
            style and under the same rules.

            The BC Epic is a 1000km (1066 to be exact), 11 600m elevation
            traverse across South Central BC starting in Merritt and ending in
            Fernie (or vice versa if you choose) mostly along the Trans Canada
            Trail. The route is about 80% off road on mostly old decommissioned
            railgrades (Kettle Valley Railroad from Brookmere to Midway,
            Columbia Western from Midway to Castlegar and Great Northern from
            Salmo to Nelson), with a few sections of challenging singletrack and
            the rest mostly rough gravel forest service road and about 100km
            paved.

            It is spectacular ride crossing through a great diversity of terrian
            and ecosystems with remarkable scenery, trestles hundereds of feet
            high and multiple tunnels (longest almost a kilometre!) along the
            bed of some of the most expensive railway ever laid through the
            mountains. There are plenty of camping, re-supply points and
            services along the route. Take on the challenge and ride the Epic!

            Please take note - don't let the railgrades decieve you - this is
            tough route! In the ingaugural run only 7 of 15 starters finished.

            The railgrade is often very rough with loose gravel, washouts and
            washboard and often hard work to ride. A crossbike is not suited for
            this surface. Although it had been completed with a trailer it is
            not recommended and the singletrack section between Castelgar and
            Trail is not doable with a trailer (it was bypassed by the rider who
            completed the route with the trailer).
